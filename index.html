              <em><p><strong>This year has seen us go through a significant transition at the Engine Room, not only in leadership, but also in how we work as an organisation. Our focus was on strengthening our foundations, including by completing a smooth leadership transition, and I’m proud that we’ve done that in many different ways.</strong></p> 

              <p><strong>We end 2018 as a team of 16, with staff based on five continents.</strong> This year, we sharpened team strategies, honed internal processes to support well-being and refined our strategy to reflect the rapidly changing political environments we work within. We hired our first team member based in Asia, developed an organisation-wide learning strategy, produced useful research on how data and technology can be used strategically and responsibly and provided direct support to more than 100 organisations.</p> 

              <p><strong>As we grew, we reflected on how our evolution as a remote, international team has shaped our core values and how to hold ourselves accountable to these values.</strong> We are lucky to have a team that approaches work with humility, excellence and compassion. This year’s retrospective is shaped in large part by our organisational values, and we’re proud to share them publicly for the first time!</p>

              <p><strong>As I evolve in the role of Executive Director, I am also constantly reminded of how much we owe to those who came before us and who support us externally</strong> – former team members who contributed with their hard work, co-founder Alix Dunn who shaped this team into who we are today with her intelligence and vision, and of course our wonderful partners and funders who trust and support us.</p>

              <p>As ever, our digital door is open, and we all welcome your thoughts, comments and questions.</p></em>
              <p>- Julia Keseru, Executive Director</p>

              <h3>Organisational security through dialogue</h3>
              <p>A SAFETAG fellowship gave us the opportunity to strengthen our organisational security assessment work, and we documented lessons learned from safety audits with organisations in Latin America to inform future assessments. For instance, audits are more successful when there is trust between both parties and when the organisation (including management) fully recognises the need for support. We also discovered that audits require time for lengthy and in-depth dialogue and that one-on-one conversations with team members are essential to building trust. 
              <p>We learned so much that we were inspired to lead a holistic organisational security session at our own staff retreat in July to build on The Engine Room’s significant work in this area. Thanks to the SAFETAG experience, we feel more equipped to assist organisations in making lasting, effective changes to their security culture. But it’s about more than protection. The partners we worked with were able to implement better security practices and explore the psycho-emotional aspects of their work, connecting organisational wellbeing to growth.</p>
              
              <h3>Methods for monitoring influence</h3>
              <p>As political corruption takes on new forms, civil society needs new tactics to fight back. In late 2017 The Engine Room and Ojo Público convened corruption experts from Latin America to discuss political influence and explore investigation methodologies, advocacy tactics and collaborative solutions. Supported by Influence Mapping group, our community-focused approach enabled participants to enjoy creative exchange, build shared understanding for future work and take learnings back to their organisations. Together they created four methods to monitor politically exposed persons and use the data for advocacy and communication.</p> 
              <p>These methods were featured in 2018 through a project report, a blog post with handy infographics and print materials, such as posters. Not only have participants and partners been using these methods and introducing them to colleagues and students, but they are also training journalists covering political corruption through the facilitation approach we designed with Ojo Público. This unexpected result is a good example of the fact that the process of a project is as important as what comes out of it. </p>

              <h3>Making space by saying farewell</h3>
              <p>This year, we practiced making space in another big way, saying farewell to our former Executive Director and co-founder, Alix. When answering the question of why Alix was stepping down, we think her words put it best:</p>
              <p><em>“For two main reasons. 1) We have considerable momentum and a bright, effective, and committed team in place that is well positioned for a transition; and 2) I believe that this community needs new (and more) leaders – and a primary way that happens is if people in positions of power move out of the way.”</em></p>
              <p>Practicing what she preached, Alix made the way for new leaders to step up within The Engine Room and for us to continue growing.</p>

Many of the local organisations we work with don’t have the resources — or access — to certain spheres of influence, so we see part of our role as handing the mic over to them. Sometimes this means referring local organisations for work that we are approached for, or supporting smaller organisations in their grant applications. This might mean they get the funds, not us, and we think this is a good thing. Our goal is to transfer capacity, resources, and power to the people who are best positioned to make the most of it.</p>
