              <p><em>2017 has been an eventful year, and has inspired all of us at The Engine Room to continue our support work with a growing sense of energy and urgency. From building tools that improve non-profit organisations’ capacities, to advocating for partners and friends on the frontlines of the struggle for human rights, we believe that our  work matters now more than ever.</em></p>
              <p><em>As a support organisation we are always searching for new ways to increase the impact of our partnerships. To that end, we have adopted new practices and systems that enable our global team and network of partners to do their work well. You can read about some of those in our Support Services and Culture sections below. Through 2017, we continued our work with <span class="tooltip">Matchbox<span class="tooltiptext">Engine Room program offering intensive data and technology project support to partners.</span></span> partners and forged new relationships with  with new partners around the globe. We researched  emerging technology  to explore ways it can power the work of social change.  Individually, we learned new skills, welcomed new family members, explored new territories, and much more. As we jump into 2018, I am proud of the continued growth we’ve each achieved individually and as The Engine Room team. Here’s to a 2017 of support, learning, and social change, and a 2018 of more fruitful partnerships, equitable innovation, and impact!<br /><br /></em>

              <p>As a support organisation, our work centres on our partners and their needs. We combine knowledge of cultural and social nuances, expertise on technology and data, and learnings drawn from diverse sectors and use them to tackle real-world challenges.</p>
              <p>Over the years we have refined and defined a spectrum of support formats that range from quick and targeted support, to longer-term research and partnerships. This year, we formalised the support we offer to partners, which you can read about in our <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/TER-What-We-Do-2017.pdf" target="_blank">What We Do guide</a>. Each stream of work has its own dynamic workflow, has grown organically and pragmatically, and continues to evolve.</p>

              <p>Our work impacts a diverse group of social change actors - from established social change organisations to individuals with powerful ideas; from budding activists, to foundations. We make data and technology more accessible so it can be put to use in making the world a better place. Partners come away with more knowledge and connections, increased confidence in evaluating new data and technology applications, and new ways to do their work. And the social sector grows its capacity to use the tools at its disposal to do even more. </p>

Many of the local organisations we work with don’t have the resources — or access — to certain spheres of influence, so we see part of our role as handing the mic over to them. Sometimes this means referring local organisations for work that we are approached for, or supporting smaller organisations in their grant applications. This might mean they get the funds, not us, and we think this is a good thing. Our goal is to transfer capacity, resources, and power to the people who are best positioned to make the most of it.</p>
