              <em><p><strong>This year has seen us go through a significant transition at the Engine Room, not only in leadership, but also in how we work as an organisation. Our focus was on strengthening our foundations, including by completing a smooth leadership transition, and I’m proud that we’ve done that in many different ways.</strong></p> 

              <p><strong>We end 2018 as a team of 16, with staff based on five continents.</strong> This year, we sharpened team strategies, honed internal processes to support well-being and refined our strategy to reflect the rapidly changing political environments we work within. We hired our first team member based in Asia, developed an organisation-wide learning strategy, produced useful research on how data and technology can be used strategically and responsibly and provided direct support to more than 100 organisations.</p> 

              <p><strong>As we grew, we reflected on how our evolution as a remote, international team has shaped our core values and how to hold ourselves accountable to these values.</strong> We are lucky to have a team that approaches work with humility, excellence and compassion. This year’s retrospective is shaped in large part by our organisational values, and we’re proud to share them publicly for the first time!</p>

              <p><strong>As I evolve in the role of Executive Director, I am also constantly reminded of how much we owe to those who came before us and who support us externally</strong> – former team members who contributed with their hard work, co-founder Alix Dunn who shaped this team into who we are today with her intelligence and vision, and of course our wonderful partners and funders who trust and support us.</p>

              <p>As ever, our digital door is open, and we all welcome your thoughts, comments and questions.</p></em>

              <h2>Organisational security through dialogue</h2>
              <p>A SAFETAG fellowship gave us the opportunity to strengthen our organisational security assessment work, and we documented lessons learned from safety audits with organisations in Latin America to inform future assessments. For instance, audits are more successful when there is trust between both parties and when the organisation (including management) fully recognises the need for support. We also discovered that audits require time for lengthy and in-depth dialogue and that one-on-one conversations with team members are essential to building trust. 
              <p>We learned so much that we were inspired to lead a holistic organisational security session at our own staff retreat in July to build on The Engine Room’s significant work in this area. Thanks to the SAFETAG experience, we feel more equipped to assist organisations in making lasting, effective changes to their security culture. But it’s about more than protection. The partners we worked with were able to implement better security practices and explore the psycho-emotional aspects of their work, connecting organisational wellbeing to growth.</p>
              
              <h2>Monitoring political influence</h2>
              <p>As political corruption takes on new forms, civil society needs new tactics to fight back. In late 2017 The Engine Room and Ojo Público convened corruption experts from Latin America to discuss political influence and explore investigation methodologies, advocacy tactics and collaborative solutions. Supported by Influence Mapping group, our community-focused approach enabled participants to enjoy creative exchange, build shared understanding for future work and take learnings back to their organisations. Together they created four methods to monitor politically exposed persons and use the data for advocacy and communication.</p> 
              <p>These methods were featured in 2018 through a project report, a blog post with handy infographics and print materials, such as posters. Not only have participants and partners been using these methods and introducing them to colleagues and students, but they are also training journalists covering political corruption through the facilitation approach we designed with Ojo Público. This unexpected result is a good example of the fact that the process of a project is as important as what comes out of it. </p>

              <h2>Making space by saying farewell</h2>
              <p>This year, we practiced making space in another big way, saying farewell to our former Executive Director and co-founder, Alix. When answering the question of why Alix was stepping down, we think her words put it best:</p>
              <p><em>“For two main reasons. 1) We have considerable momentum and a bright, effective, and committed team in place that is well positioned for a transition; and 2) I believe that this community needs new (and more) leaders – and a primary way that happens is if people in positions of power move out of the way.”</em></p>
              <p>Practicing what she preached, Alix made the way for new leaders to step up within The Engine Room and for us to continue growing.</p>

              <h2>Evaluating risks of biometric technology</h2>
              <p>When we began working with Oxfam on a responsible approach to biometric technology, the organisation was coming to the end of their self-imposed moratorium on the use of biometrics in their programming. We interviewed experts from humanitarian agencies, academia, civil society and the private sector, and we convened a community call to solicit opinions from the responsible data community. We found that there is widespread use of biometrics in development and humanitarian contexts, with wide-ranging systems among UN agencies and pilots or discrete applications in organisations such as Mercy Corps and Save the Children. Ultimately, the clear, definite risks and inconsistent benefits of using this type of technology in humanitarian work convinced Oxfam not to deploy biometrics except in some very clearly-defined use cases. The organisation’s robust responsible program data policy provided a good foundation for allowing the research results to guide their decision.</p>

              <h2>Sharing funder data responsibly</h2>
              <p>Funders often want to be transparent about the programming they support – but in a climate that is hostile to civil society, publishing grantee information can turn organisations into targets. So, how can funders share grantee data responsibly? We worked with Ariadne and 360Giving to explore answers to this question, and published the resulting conversation guide in October. Geared toward funders and grantmakers interested in taking a responsible approach towards grantee data, Sharing data responsibly: A conversation guide for funders addresses data collection, storage and sharing. Methods like obtaining consent, conducting risk assessments and minimising the amount of data collected can be vital but complicated. It’s critical that funders have open, frank conversations with grantees to build the trusted relationships that are needed. We’re happy to see that the guide is already being put to use by consultants and funders alike.</p>

              <h2>Upgrading our support, pinpointing impact</h2>
              <p>One of the key ways we provide support to partners is through Light Touch Support (LiTS), where we offer quick, targeted support to organisations looking for help incorporating data and technology into their programmes or projects. This year, we were eager to create new internal documents to help us deliver LiTS even more effectively. We developed a set of guides and templates that would help The Engine Room team members carry out LiTS and upgraded the way we ask partners to give us feedback. While we built these procedural upgrades, we also did a deep dive on impact, developing a framework that looks at the value of our support within the broader chain of impact that our partners already produce. We are keen to share more about this framework, continue developing it by adding long-term check-ins and share stories of important LiTS engagements in the months to come.</p>

              <h2>Co-creating a grounded programme strategy</h2>
              <p>At their most useful, strategies can connect programme goals to on-the-ground realities. But crafting a strategy that can actually respond to expressed needs isn’t a non-linear process. When we started working with Hivos’ Digital Defenders Partnership (DDP) to develop their next four-year strategy, we dove into this complexity by taking an approach grounded in participatory research. We didn’t only consult stakeholders, but tried to make sure they were part of the production itself, creating knowledge that was useful for their own work. We sought to work with in-country researchers and at-risk communities in addition to working with DDP, striving to create a process that was useful and productive for everyone involved. Managing such a diverse pool of collaborators allowed us to create a strategy that was validated by needs that we all recognised. Critically, this work was embedded in communities because they were the ones who shaped it.</p>

              <h2>Delving into digital security</h2>
              <p>Technology gives us superpowers – but it is also our Achilles heel. That’s why, together with the Ford Foundation, we took a close look at how civil society can strengthen their digital security practices, with a special focus on where grantee-funder relationships have room for conversation and improvement. We were excited to present our report on the findings of many months of research, and we also introduced a new format for sharing research findings: the Propeller Series. In the Series, we distilled the report into six easy-to-read emails that were sent over the course of six weeks. So far, more than 200 people have signed up to receive the emails, and we received enthusiastic support for the format from readers.</p>

              <h2>Broadening our direct support</h2>
              <p>This year, we launched a new round of Matchbox partnerships, expanding our programme to include not just organisations working strictly on transparency and accountability, but those that are improving their social and political contexts more broadly, too. Expanding our call in this way was fruitful but not without challenges. It meant building a careful selection pipeline that educated potential applicants along the way and included a thoughtful evaluation process in response to the significant diversity in the applicant pool. We received nearly 100 applications from organisations in Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa, and we are eager to welcome six new partners into our next cohort. Congratulations to X, X, X, X and X!</p>

              <h2>Creating responsible data policies</h2>
              <p>Over the past few years, as responsible data approaches have spread, we’ve seen more organisations move towards institutionalising these approaches with the introduction of responsible data policies or guidelines. This year, we supported two organisations to develop responsible data policies – Open Tech Fund and German organisation GIZ. In both cases, we worked with their teams to build a picture of their current behaviours regarding data and their biggest challenges. Then, we reviewed current institutional guidance on key responsible data issues – like managing sensitive data, recognising power disparities among their communities and staff and recognising the limitations of quantitative data. We’ve learned that for policies and guidelines like this to be successful, they need to be rooted in an institution’s existing values – so we made sure to frame key points around their respective values. For GIZ, we developed Responsible Data Guidelines to support their staff, spread across 120 countries, to work with their partners in a more responsible way, alongside a toolkit of practical materials to help the implementation of those practices. For Open Tech Fund, we produced an internal responsible data policy. As ever, we realise that a policy is just the first step – next comes implementation.
              </p>

              <h2>Fighting for migrant worker rights</h2>
              <p>Migrant workers around the world operate in contexts full of power asymmetries:  between their recruiters, employers, various intermediaries and other migrant workers themselves. Together with researchers Bassina Farbenblum, Laurie Berg and Angela Kintominas, and supported by the International Migration Initiative at OSF, we examined the role that new technologies could have in the fight for rights and justice for migrant workers. Our focus was on the role responsible data has to play in this context. Ultimately, we identified several responsible data issues at play, very few of which are entirely unique to the migrant workers’ sector. From managing user expectations, to the importance of informed consent and sustainability, we saw echoes of our research findings from other sectors.</p>

              <h2>Balancing transparency and data protection</h2>
              <p>Beneficial ownership is the process of opening a company anonymously, and technology advances enable more ways to track down information about these companies. The Engine Room partnered with OpenOwnership and The B Team to address how to balance beneficial ownership transparency and data protection. Given that beneficial owners are sometimes in different jurisdictions than their companies, disclosing personal data about the owners can violate data protection laws. Our research used a rights-based approach and asked three key questions: Is publishing beneficial ownership data in central public registers lawful? Is publishing in central public registers an effective way of meeting a legitimate aim? What are the potential impacts to privacy of public beneficial ownership registers, and can they be minimised or mitigated? It was a challenge to find this balance, but we see it as critical for tackling illegal financial activity in a way that recognises responsible data principles. We presented the early findings at the International Anti-Corruption Conference in Copenhagen in October 2018, and the report will be out in early 2019. </p>

              <p>The majority of technology support organisations are based in the US or Europe, and are led by individuals with a lot of power, wealth, or privilege. We believe <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/diversity-is-a-competency/" target="_blank">diversity is a competency</a>, so a large part of our work has been to identify, support, and shift equity to local partners, peers and leaders who are often underrepresented. Many of the local organisations we work with don’t have the resources — or access — to certain spheres of influence, so we see part of our role as handing the mic over to them. Sometimes this means referring local organisations for work that we are approached for, or supporting smaller organisations in their grant applications. This might mean they get the funds, not us, and we think this is a good thing. Our goal is to transfer capacity, resources, and power to the people who are best positioned to make the most of it.</p>

              <p>As with every year, we upped our game to build a remote team environment that works and learns smoothly. Externally, we saw how the value of our research lies in ensuring that organisations who could use our findings have it at their fingertips, when they need it (and in diverse <a href="https://soundcloud.com/engnroom/sets" target="_blank">formats like audio series, too</a>). We prioritised engagement and communications – hiring a full-time Communications Coordinator – and will be working more to develop our outreach and engagement with new communities in 2018.

              <p>In 2017, we wound down our Norwegian operations, and are now solely operating as a US 501c3. We adopted new human resources platforms and practices, too; this might not sound thrilling, but it keeps our team members and consultants working smoothly!
